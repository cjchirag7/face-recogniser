# Face-recogniser
<h1> Project for Data Science club - (Project no. 6 ) </h1>                                                                <h2> Identification of student using dynamic student database </h2> 
<h3> The simple idea of face recognition can be adopted as an extensible idea. With this project, we aim to develop a portal which can be used to display the details of a student using his face. If the information for a given face is not in the database, the database has to be updated with newly obtained data. </h3>
