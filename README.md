# Face-recogniser
<h1> Identification of student using dynamic student database </h1> 
<h5> The simple idea of face recognition can be adopted as an extensible idea. With this project, we aim to develop a portal which can be used to display the details of a student using his face. If the information for a given face is not in the database, the database has to be updated with newly obtained data. </h5>
